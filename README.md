Simple online test that ended up taking me all morning because i'm an eedjit.
***
The program takes in 4 strings:

One that refers to a List of words on certain topics (Fruit, Family)

Three that refer to the IDs of words within the above list. (Words learned)

The three latter strings are converted into a list, and then the algorithm adds those words to the a pool of learned words.
The algorithm finally returns 3 random words from the 'learned words' list.
***
Considering it should have taken me about an hour,
I would have hoped by now to have integrated some nice visuals into the unity project to try to distract from how goddamn slow I was.

I feel the algorithm should probably also return the amount of times the word has been learned before,
or more practically, there should probably be a seperate variable for how many times the Sticker has been earned,
and it should return that, so the child can see how many duplicates they own.

In terms of testing it out, there is a demo on itch.io here:
